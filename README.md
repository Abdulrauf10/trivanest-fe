# 🧠 Trivanest Frontend — Web App for Online Psychological Consultation Platform

Welcome to the frontend of Trivanest, a modern online consultation platform built to connect users with professional psychologists—safely, efficiently, and comfortably from home.

“Mental wellness deserves convenience, security, and empathy — Trivanest delivers that with thoughtful tech.”

## 💭 Problem Statement

How might we create an online experience where individuals can easily schedule, confirm, and attend private therapy sessions—without friction?

## 🎯 Solution Overview

Trivanest was developed to simplify mental health access by solving key issues:

Long wait times for appointments

Difficult registration or onboarding processes

Lack of clear session confirmations

💡 Design Thinking in Action

1. Empathize
   Interviews with potential users and psychologists revealed frustration with traditional appointment systems and unclear communication.

2. Define
   Users need a frictionless onboarding flow, reliable meeting confirmations, and a system they can trust with personal data.

3. Ideate
   Architect a clean, modular backend system to handle users, scheduling, email automation, and secure data management.

4. Prototype
   Built a backend using NestJS (a progressive Node.js framework).

Integrated with email services to confirm sessions.

Structured with RESTful APIs to support frontend integrations.
